  The C++ code is far from optimized because I myself am an Arduino and C++ newbie! ;)
  But in writing this code and learning a LOT from others, I gradually comprehended the inner workings of
  DCF and C++.

  If you enjoy exploring the Arduino and DCF77 as much as I did, maybe by using and/or learning from this
  sketch, my goal is reached. :o)

  USE PCB DESIGNS AT YOUR OWN RISK, I TESTED THE V1.0 BOARDS BUT NOT THE 1.1 REVISIONS
